<h1>Education</h1>

2015 – 2020	Liceo Scientifico Maria Madre Mazzarello, Torino (Italy)
I privileged the study of economics, human sciences, and psychology. National Final Examination: 86/100
To conceal studies with my sport activities, I studied as a “home student”, giving exams at the end of my second and third year of high school to be admitted to the next year.
